# Obesity and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk Analysis

## Project Overview
The **Obesity and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk Analysis** project focuses on examining the relationship between obesity and cardiovascular disease risk using data analysis techniques. The primary objective is to analyze the dataset, perform descriptive statistics, and visualize key trends to understand the impact of obesity on CVD risk factors.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of various health parameters related to obesity and cardiovascular disease, including:
- **Age**: The age of individuals in the dataset.
- **BMI (Body Mass Index)**: A measure of body fat based on height and weight.
- **Blood Pressure**: Includes systolic and diastolic pressure readings.
- **Cholesterol Levels**: Categorized into normal, above normal, and high.
- **Glucose Levels**: Indicating normal, above normal, or high levels.
- **Smoking and Alcohol Consumption**: Lifestyle factors contributing to CVD risk.
- **Physical Activity**: The level of physical exercise performed by individuals.
- **CVD Diagnosis**: Whether an individual has been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease.

## Analysis Conducted
1. **Descriptive Analysis**: Summarizing key statistics for all variables.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, data normalization, and feature engineering.
3. **CVD Risk Distribution**: Visualizing the distribution of CVD risk across different obesity levels.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying relationships between obesity and other health factors.
5. **Impact of Lifestyle Factors**: Analyzing how smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity influence CVD risk.
6. **Comparing CVD Incidence**: Stratifying the data based on BMI categories to compare CVD occurrence.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Visualization**: Bar charts, histograms, correlation heatmaps

## Key Insights
- Higher BMI levels are strongly correlated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
- Individuals with high blood pressure and cholesterol levels show a significantly higher probability of CVD.
- Lifestyle factors such as smoking and lack of physical activity contribute significantly to cardiovascular disease risk.
- Data preprocessing techniques like normalization and handling missing values improve analysis accuracy.

## Future Enhancements
- Expanding the dataset to include more diverse demographic groups.
- Applying **machine learning models** to predict CVD risk based on health parameters.
- Developing an interactive **dashboard** for real-time visualization of CVD risk trends.

## How to Use the Project
1. Load the dataset into a **Jupyter Notebook**.
2. Execute the provided Python scripts to perform data preprocessing and analysis.
3. Use **visualizations** to explore key trends and insights.
4. Modify or extend the analysis based on additional health parameters.
